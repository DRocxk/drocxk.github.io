# About

I am a highly motivated security professional with a passion for protecting my clientsâ€™ valuable data.

I have extensive experience with multiple security tools and know how to properly use them to identify vulnerabilities in target systems. I have a strong understanding of the most common network protocols and can effectively detect common security flaws. I have worked on numerous projects for clients in the financial, healthcare, and retail sectors and understand how to properly secure their data.

I am also a certified ethical hacker and understand the importance of staying up to date with the latest security trends and techniques.

I am a self-starter and am always looking for ways to improve my skill set and stay ahead of the curve. If given the opportunity, I would be a great asset to any team and will strive to ensure the highest levels of security for any organization.
